gr-mixalot
==========

gr-mixalot is intended to be a set of GNU Radio blocks/utilities to encode 
pager messages.  Currently it only supports POCSAG numeric and alphanumeric 
pages.

The POCSAG encoder has been tested against many variants of the Motorola Bravo 
series, as well as the ATI Wireless CCP-6000.  Please get in touch if you
find a device that doesn't work properly.
